                    <h3>Why Porto?</h3>
                    <h2>Porto, the city of bridges and port wine</h2>
                    <p>Porto is a city that beautifully combines its rich history with a modern vibe. It's located next
                        to the Douro River, and
                        the old town, called Ribeira, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You'll see colorful buildings
                        adorned
                        with traditional
                        azulejos, telling stories of the past. And don't forget the smell of aged port wine in the air
                        when
                        you
                        visit the
                        historic wine cellars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Porto isn't stuck in the past; it's buzzing with creativity. There's a thriving arts scene,
                        and
                        you
                        can't miss
                        trying the iconic Francesinha sandwich. The city's welcoming locals, stunning riverfront views,
                        and
                        deep
                        cultural roots
                        make it a place where you can explore and uncover its unique charm and secrets.
